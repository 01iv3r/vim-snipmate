Quickly install with:

    git clone git://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim.git
	cd snipmate.vim
	cp -R * ~/.vim

Note: You're using a fork which is located at

    git://github.com/MarcWeber/snipmate.vim.git

    This forks differs in the following way:

    - snippets are loaded lazily.

    - snippets are no longer cached. Thus you always get the snippets you just
      wrote to a file without reloading anything.

    - when visually selecting a snippet in a .snippets file you can press <cr>
      to replace spaces by tabs automatically in a smart way
